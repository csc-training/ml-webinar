# CSC training slides LaTeX template

Still experimental, pull requests are welcome.

## Requirements

The template uses the TTF font *Corbel*, which is the same one used in the official PowerPoint templates.

## Usage

To compile the example file, just run:

```bash
xelatex example.tex
```

Note that we are using `xelatex` as it has nice support for TTF fonts.
